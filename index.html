			<h2>About Travel🗺</h2>
			<p> I have traveled a lot✈️. First of all, I spend all my summers in Corsica as my father is from the bay. Then, I had the chance to be part of a host family for 1 month in Brighton, England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. Furthermore, I was able to spend 1 week in Hong Kong🇭🇰 with my family which made me learn a lot about the Chinese culture which I appreciate a lot. Finally, I was able to travel to Martinique🇲🇶 because I have family there on my mother's side. I hope that this is only the beginning of my experiences and that I will have the chance to travel all over the world😊.</p>
